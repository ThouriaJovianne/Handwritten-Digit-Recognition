# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition is a Deep Learning Project within the Deep Learning Course led by Dr. Hadjer Benmeziane in Limitless Learning institute

Thoughout this notebook, we will work to optimize a Pytorch model to recognize handwritten difits from the MNIST dataset.

# What I learned from this project
* Delved into PyTorch 👨‍💻 and mastered its basic operations to build powerful models.

* Explored a variety of training optimization techniques 🕵️‍♂️ such as adding dropout layers, implementing regulizers and utilizing early stopping to enhance model performance. 

* Conducted experiments with different hyperparameters 🔬, observing how they impacted my model's learning process and accuracy.
