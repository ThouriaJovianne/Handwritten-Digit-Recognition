# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten Digit Recognition is a Deep Learning Project within the Deep Learning Course led by Dr. Hadjer Benmeziane in Limitless Learning institute

Thoughout this notebook, we will work to optimize a Pytorch model to recognize handwritten difits from the MNIST dataset.

# What I learned from this project
* Got hands-on experience with Pytorch, and understood its basic operations and how to build models with it.
* Explored various training optimization techniques such as adding dropout layers, implementing regulizers, and utilizing early stopping to enhance model performance.
* Tested different hyperparameters and obsrvered how they impacted my model's learning process and accuracy.
